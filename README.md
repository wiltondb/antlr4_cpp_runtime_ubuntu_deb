**ANTLR** (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser
generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text
or binary files.  It is widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks.
From a grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build parse trees and also
generates a listener interface (or visitor) that makes it easy to respond to
the recognition of phrases of interest.
